Killing ASCII characters and words(the monsters) while collecting loot from them in form of ASCII characters. Same characters that are used in VIM commands. These are also the weapons used to kill characters and move through the map. As the game progresses new characters are introduced..

# Ideas

Copy player such that you now control two entities equally and when you send 
commands, both entities responds to it and it will use twice the ammo.
